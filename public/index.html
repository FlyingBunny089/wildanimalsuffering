                    <h3>...and why it matters</h3>
                    <p class="subheading">
                        We tend to idealise nature and the lives of wild animals, but in reality, their lives can be really tough. They have to deal with harsh weather conditions, hunger, thirst, disease, violence from other animals and more.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        When we suffer, we seek relief. For animals, their suffering doesn't become any less unpleasant because they live in the wild, and pain feels the same for them, regardless of whether or not humans are the cause of it. The suffering of wild animals matters. It matters to them, and it should matter to us.
